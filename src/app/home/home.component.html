    <p>
      The project e-Sanad aims at providing a centralized platform for contactless, faceless, cashless and paperless
      document verification/attestation/apostille service for Indian citizens, foreigners who have obtained documents
      from document issuing authorities (DIAs) in India.These include all type of documents i.e personal, educational
      and commercial. The project is being implemented in phased manner and proposed to extend the service to Indians
      residing abroad. The system ensures that the foreign employers/other verification agencies get digitally verified
      genuine documents.</p>
    <p>
      The primary requirement for the attestation/apostille through e-Sanad is the availability of the document in
      digital depository. The project was launched on 24th May 2017with CBSE documents depository (documents from year
      2014 onwards), since then it has been adopted by various document issuing authorities (DIAs) including National
      Academic Depository (NAD). The NAD project being implemented by (MHRD) has been integrated with e-sanadfor
      enhancing the digital depository of the documents. The verification/attestation of the documents issued by the
      document issuing authorities (DIAs) integrated with NAD would be done online. The Physical copy of CBSE documents
      from year 2014 onwards would not be accepted for attestation / apostille.</p>
    <p>
      The project has been developed in highly configurable mode for integration with various other depositories of the
      Document Issuing Authorities, Digi Locker, depositories of States/UTs. The ministry is under discussion with
      other Document Issuing Authority (DIAs) under State Government for integration in phased manner.The pre-requisite
      for integration is the availability of the digital depository of the documents with the concerned Document
      Issuing Authority (DIAs) such as CBSE and NAD. This service would be extended to other DIAs as per their
      readiness for providing the digital depository of documents issued by them.</p>
    <p>
      The documents will be attested/apostilled by the Ministry of External Affairs only after the verification by the
      concerned DIA and the digital copy of the same will be send to applicant by speed post. The documents where
      digital depository is not available, would continue to be attested/apostilled as being done previously, the
      procedure for the same is explained at: http://mea.gov.in/apostille.htm.

            Are we integrating this project with States/UTs also??
          </mat-panel-title>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p>To begin with, the e-Sanad, will start with CBSE depository (for years 2014 & onwards) and verification of
          the CBSE documents would be done online. As regards its implementation/integration with States/UTs, the
          matter is being taken up with Telengana State, as a pilot project and others will be included in a phased
          manner.</p>

        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p>The project is being implemented by NIC in coordination with CBSE, States/UTs and the Ministry of External
          Affairs in a phased manner. Initially only those Document Issuing Authorities(DIAs), that have digital
          depository of their documents(such as CBSE), are taken on board . This service would be extended to other
          DIAs in phased manner as and when they are capable to providing digital depository of documents issued by
          them.</p>

            What is an Apostille and when do I need one?
          </mat-panel-title>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p>An Apostille is a certificate that authenticates the origin of a public document (e.g., a birth, marriage or
          death certificate, a judgment, an extract of a register or a notarial attestation). The Model Apostille
          Certificate is reproduced at the beginning of this brochure. Apostilles can only be issued for documents
          issued in one country party to the Apostille Convention and that are to be used in another country which is
          also a party to the Convention.

          You will need an Apostille if all of the following apply:

          The country where the document was issued is party to the Apostille Convention; and
          The country in which the document is to be used is party to the Apostille Convention; and
          The law of the country where the document wasissued considers it to be a public document; and
          The country in which the document is to be used requires an Apostille in order to recognise it as a foreign
          public document.
          An Apostille may never be used for the recognition of a document in the country here that document was issued
          â€“ Apostilles are strictly for the use of public documents abroad!

          An Apostille may not be required if the laws, regulations, or practice in force in the country where the
          public document is to be used have abolished or simplified the requirement of an Apostille, or have exempted
          the document from any legalisation requirement. Such simplification or exemption may also result from a
          treaty or other agreement that is in force between the country where the public document is to be used and
          the country that issued it (e.g., some other Hague Conventions exempt documents from legalisation or any
          analogous formality, including an Apostille).

          If you have any doubts, you should ask the intended recipient of your document whether an Apostille is
          necessary in your particular case.</p>

      <mat-expansion-panel>
        <mat-expansion-panel-header>
          <mat-panel-title>
            In which countries does the Apostille Convention apply?
          </mat-panel-title>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p>The Apostille Convention only applies if both the country where the public document was issued and the
          country where the public document is to be used are parties to the Convention. A comprehensive and updated
          list of the countries where the Apostille Convention applies, or will soon apply, is available in the
          Apostille Section of the Hague Conference website â€“ look for the link entitled Status table of the
          Apostille Convention.

          The Status table of the Apostille Convention has two parts: the first part lists countries that have joined
          the Apostille Convention and are also Members of the Hague Conference (i.e., the Organisation that developed
          the Convention); the second part lists countries that have joined the Apostille Convention but are not
          Members of the Hague Conference. In other words, a country does not need to be a Member of the Hague
          Conference to be party to the Apostille Convention.

          When checking the Status table of the Apostille Convention, always keep the following in mind:

          Check if both the country where the public document was issued and the country where the document is to be
          used are listed in either part of the Status table.
          It does not matter whether a country appears in the first or the second part of the Status table â€“ the
          Convention applies equally to Members and non-Members of the Organisation.
          Check the date of entry into force of the Convention for both countries. Look for the column entitled
          â€˜EIFâ€™ â€“ only after that date can the relevant country issue and receive Apostilles.
          There are different ways for a country to become a party to the Convention (ratification, accession,
          succession or continuation), but these differences have no impact on how the Convention operates in a
          country.
          If one of the countries has acceded to the Convention, check that the other country has not objected to that
          accession; to find out, see the column entitled â€˜Typeâ€™ next to the acceding countryâ€™s name and check if
          there is a link entitled â€˜A**â€™ â€“ if so, click on it and check whether the other country is listed.
          Check whether the Convention applies to the entire territory of a country or only to parts of it; to find
          out, see if there is a link in the columns entitled â€˜Extâ€™ and â€˜Res/D/Nâ€™ â€“ if so, click on it and
          read the relevant information.</p>

            What do I do if either the country where my public document was issued or the country where I need to use
            my public document is not a party to the Apostille Convention?
          </mat-panel-title>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p>If your public document was issued or is to be used in a country where the Apostille Convention does not
          apply, you should contact the Embassy or a Consulate of the country where you intend to use the document in
          order to find out what your options are. The Permanent Bureau (Secretariat) of the Hague Conference does not
          provide assistance in such cases.</p>

            To which documents does the Apostille Convention apply?
          </mat-panel-title>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p>The Convention only applies to public documents. Whether or not a document is a public document is
          determined by the law of the country in which the document was issued. Countries typically apply the
          Convention to a wide variety of documents. Most Apostilles are issued for documents of an administrative
          nature, including birth, marriage and death certificates; documents emanating from an authority or an
          official connected with a court, tribunal or commission; extracts from commercial registers and other
          registers; patents; notarial acts and notarial attestations (acknowledgments) of signatures; school,
          university and other academic diplomas issued by public institutions. The Apostille Convention does not apply
          to documents executed by diplomatic or consular agents. The Convention also excludes from its scope certain
          administrative documents related to commercial or customs operations.</p>

        <p>Any type of document viz personal, educational or commercial can be authenticated/apostilled using e-Sanad.
          The document should be available in the digital repository for getting attestation/apostille through e-Sanad.</p>
